# Token checking at unmatched speeds
With RapidCord you can seamlessly switch between using proxies and using your local internet connection to check tokens in order to avoid rate-limiting. It is a feature rich combination of
all the tools a discord token checker needs in order to be useful, as well as lightweight. Designed with user experience in mind, you won't have to worry about installing
python dependencies ever again. 

### How to install

Go to the **Releases** tab and download the latest release binary. Note: Some antiviruses may flag RapidCord because it connects to the Discord
API and isn't signed with a code certificate.

### Features
```
- SOCKS Proxy integration
- Multithreading
- Anti-ratelimiting
- Anti-tokenkilling
```

By using RapidCord, you will not kill your tokens when checking them as you would with some generic Python token checker someone wrote up in 5 minutes.
